McAfee Pump and Dump bot.

Was used around a year ago when John McAfee was pumping and dumping cryptocurrencies from his Twitter account. 

Could be rewritten to play into pump and dumps in the future. Even though I would highly advice to not participate in pump and dump schemes, the bot works and made me some profit.
